# Basic Components

In the preceding section, we explored the basics of Infrastructure as Code and got to know Terraform. Now, let's highlight one for Terraform's coolest features: its **declarative philosophy.** This approach allows you to define and set up infrastructure resources using a simple configuration language. Terraform only looks at where you are (initial state) and where yo want to be (destination state), applying only the right and necessary changes to get there. Which means, you don't have to worry about what's happening in between or write loads of extra code.

The core Terraform workflow consists of only four steps:

* **init** -- Initialize your workspace so Terraform can apply your code.
* **write** -- Express your infrastructure needs using code. Just like telling Terraform what you want in a language it understands.
* **plan** -- Get a sneak peek at all the changes Terraform is about to make, so you're always in the know and avoid the human-error.
* **apply** -- Execute the changes from your plan, and watch Terraform create, update, or destroy resources as needed.
