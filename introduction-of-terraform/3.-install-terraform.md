# 3. Install Terraform

Terrafrom has been intergrated with more than 1000 providers. It can be easily downloaded and installed on your local environment such as OS X, Windows, and Linux. My working environment is OS X, so here I can show you how to install on OS X and manual installation.



## Install Terraform on OS X

You need to have a **Homebrew,** which is a free and open-source package management system for Mac OS X.

Step 1. Install the **HashiCorp tap**, which is a repository of all Homebrew packages.

```
brew tap hashicorp/tap
```

Step2 . Install Terraform with `hashicorp/tap/terraform`

```
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```

Step 3. Update the terraform to the latest version

```
brew update      # make sure you have the latest version of Homebrew
brew upgrade hashicorp/tap/terraform    -- update the terraform version
```

Step 4. Verify the installation

```
terraform -help
```

If the installation is successful, you will open a new terminal session and listing Terraform's available subcommands.&#x20;

There are five  main commands are very important and we need to be very familiar with them.

&#x20; **`init`**` ``         ``#Prepare your working directory for other commands`

&#x20;` `**`validate`**`    ``#Check whether the configuration is valid`

&#x20;` `**`plan`**` ``        ``#Show changes required by the current configuration`

&#x20;` `**`apply`**`         ``#Create or update infrastructure`

&#x20; **`destroy`**`      ``#Destroy previously-created infrastructure`
